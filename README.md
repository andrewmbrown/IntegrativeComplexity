Integrative Complexity is a measure of a document in terms of how much it is aware of the possibility of more than one viewpoint.
Integrative Complexity is based on a score between 0-4 where the average score is between one and two. 
For this project, 217 State of the Union speeches have been given along with a determined Integrative Complexity.
To build the model, the frequencies of each word are given for every speech.

The models built are:
MLP Network (Regressive prediction)
Naive Bayes (Classification)
Random Forest (Classification)

The clustering portion of this project should be considered irrelevant as it did not lead to any 
useful attributes or irrelevant ones.
